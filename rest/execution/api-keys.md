# Client Application Access
> It is imperative to provide a consistent, preferably self-service, way to obtain API access tokens and register new client applications.

Every API that is publicly available **MUST** be listed in the adidas API developer portal provided by the API Management platform â€“ Mashery. A client developer **MUST** be able to register new client application using the adidas developers portal and required the application key throughout the portal.
