# API Design Platform

1. [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) is the primary platform supporting [API first approach](https://github.com/adidas-group/api-guidelines/tree/af88d15fd04ef18d6724fa65943901aab7328e7f/rest/core-principles/api-first.md). Apiary **MUST** be used during API Design.
2. Every API description **MUST** be stored in [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) under the ADIDAS GROUP team.
3. Apiary **MUST** be the **single source of truth** to learn about existing APIs within the organization.

> NOTE: Apiary supports API-first approach in multiple ways:  
> a. Validates API description for correctness and automatically generates API documentation to drive the discussion between stakeholders. \(No more emails with API description flying between stakeholders\)
>
> NOTE: The synchronization between the version control system and adidas [API Description platform](apiary.md)  
> should be automated using CI/CD framework.
