# Contributing
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

To contribute to a adidas API Guidelines simply fork the repository, commit and push the changes and open a pull request. 

## Review
Note, however, that adidas API Guidelines are followed by architects and engineers at adidas and as such any **pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by adidas API team**.

Some changes like typos, clarifications and examples can be approved relatively quick, however substantial changes, changes to the rules or addition of new rules are subject of a thorough review and approval process lead by the API team.

## Rendering at GitBook
The API guidelines are primarily intended for reading at <https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/> and as such it needed to review the documentation rendering there, not in this GitHub repository (optimize for GitBook not GitHub).
